          <h2>Auguste Renoir</h2>
          <p>Famed for his sensual nudes and charming scenes of pretty women, Auguste Renoir was a far more complex and thoughtful
          painter than generally assumed. He was a founding member of the Impressionist movement, nevertheless he ceased to
          exhibit with the group after 1877. From the 1880s until well into the twentieth century, he developed a monumental,
          classically inspired style that influenced such avant-garde giants as Pablo Picasso.</p>

          <p>Van Gogh produced more than twenty self-portraits during his Parisian sojourn (1886–88). Short of funds but determined
          nevertheless to hone his skills as a figure painter, he became his own best sitter: "I purposely bought a good enough
          mirror to work from myself, for want of a model." This picture, which shows the artist's awareness of Neo-Impressionist
          technique and color theory, is one of several that are painted on the reverse of an earlier peasant study.</p>

          <h2>Leonardo da Vinci</h2>
          <p>Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) is one of the most intriguing personalities in the history of Western art. Trained in
          Florence as a painter and sculptor in the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio (1435–1488), Leonardo is also celebrated for
          his scientific contributions. His curiosity and insatiable hunger for knowledge never left him. He was constantly
          observing, experimenting, and inventing, and drawing was, for him, a tool for recording his investigation of nature.
          Although completed works by Leonardo are few, he left a large body of drawings (almost 2,500) that record his ideas,
          most still gathered into notebooks. He was principally active in Florence (1472–ca. 1482, 1500–1508) and Milan (ca.
          1482–99, 1508–13), but spent the last years of his life in Rome (1513–16) and France (1516/17–1519), where he died. His
          genius as an artist and inventor continues to inspire artists and scientists alike centuries after his death.</p>

          <h2>Rembrandt</h2>
          <p>Rembrandt, was a Dutch Golden Age painter, printmaker and draughtsman. An innovative and prolific master in three
          media, he is generally considered one of the greatest visual artists in the history of art and the most important in
          Dutch art history. Unlike most Dutch masters of the 17th century, Rembrandt's works depict a wide range of style and subject matter, from
          portraits and self-portraits to landscapes, genre scenes, allegorical and historical scenes, biblical and mythological
          themes and animal studies. His contributions to art came in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that
          historians call the Dutch Golden Age, when Dutch art (especially Dutch painting), whilst antithetical to the Baroque
          style that dominated Europe, was prolific and innovative. This era gave rise to important new genres.</p>

          <h2>Johannes Vermeer</h2>
          <p>Vermeer ranks among the most admired of all Dutch artists, but he was much less well known in his own day and remained
          relatively obscure until the end of the nineteenth century. The main reason for this is that he produced a small number
          of pictures, perhaps about forty-five (of which thirty-six are known today), primarily for a small circle of patrons in
          Delft. Indeed, as much as half of Vermeer’s output was acquired by the local collector Pieter van Ruijven. Although
          Vermeer’s work was known to other connoisseurs in Delft and the neighboring court city of The Hague, and a few of his
          paintings sold to individuals farther afield (Antwerp and Amsterdam), most Dutch painters turned out hundreds of
          pictures for a much broader market. Adding to his image as an isolated figure are the fact that Vermeer’s teacher is
          unknown, and that he evidently had no pupils.</p>

          <p>Gustav Klimt (14 July 1862 – 6 February 1918) was an Austrian symbolist painter and one of the most prominent members of
          the Vienna Secession movement. Klimt is noted for his paintings, murals, sketches, and other objets d'art. Klimt's
          primary subject was the female body, and his works are marked by a frank eroticism. Amongst his figurative works,
          which include allegories and portraits, he painted landscapes. Among the artists of the Vienna Secession, Klimt was the
          most influenced by Japanese art and its methods</p>
